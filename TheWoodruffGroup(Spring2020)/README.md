# Capstone SLaB [The Woodruff Group]
Documentation for work completed by The Woodruff Group for Spring 2020 Capstone

The goal of this Capstone project was to improve upon previous iterations of a data collection system which could be utilized by 
researchers to collect data about a biker's environment and stress levels during bike riding trials. The current project is broken down into three main categories as listed below.

## [Android App](Android%20App)
The Android App was developed in order to take advantage of the large amount of data a mobile phone is capable of reporting about its surroundings and movement. The main goal of the app is to collect time-stamped location data, speed data, and IMU data. The collected information is then written to a text file stored on the phone. The text file can be accessed from a computer and further analyzed.
